//! Local multi-agent delegation.
//!
//! The delegation system lets the cerebellum spawn and coordinate multiple
//! specialised sub-agents within a single pares-radix instance.  Each
//! sub-agent has:
//!
//! * Its own system prompt and model preference.
//! * A curated set of allowed tool names.
//! * An isolated conversation history ([`AgentContext`]).
//!
//! The [`DelegationBroker`] accepts a list of [`SubTask`]s (one per required
//! specialisation) and executes them concurrently.  Results are merged by the
//! [`ResultAggregator`] into a single [`AggregatedResult`] that is returned
//! to the caller.
//!
//! # Built-in agents
//!
//! Three built-in definitions are provided via [`builtin::researcher`],
//! [`builtin::coder`], and [`builtin::analyst`].  They can be registered
//! into an [`AgentRegistry`] using [`AgentRegistry::register_builtins`].
//!
//! # User-defined agents
//!
//! Custom agents are defined via [`AgentDefinition`] and registered with
//! [`AgentRegistry::register`].  A [`SubTask`] selects an agent by name.
//!
//! # Concurrent execution
//!
//! [`DelegationBroker::delegate`] fans out all sub-tasks in parallel using
//! `tokio::task::JoinSet`.
